This is the Flight Software for the Carleton University 2015 CanSat team.

### What is this repository for? ###

The Flight_SW directory contains all the required code to build and deploy the firmware for the CanSat Science Vehicle designed in 2014/2015. The GroundStation_SW directory contains the code to run a ground station GUI.

### How do I get set up? ###

This software is written with CodeWarrior for MCUs (Special Edition). It is targeting a custom board with the MKL16Z.
In order to program the board (not just debug it) you must go under Project->Properties->C/C++ Build->Settings->Librarian and change Model to ewl.

### Where can I find more details about the project? ###
